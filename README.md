Project: Quantum Intelligent Agent for Medical Diagnosis (QIAMed)

The project aims to develop advanced systems for assisting or performing medical diagnosis based on a Quantum Deep Q-Learning (QDQL) model that integrates parametric quantum circuits (Quantum Neural Networks - QNNs).
A parametric quantum circuit or quantum agent would allow clinical data to be encoded directly into quantum rotations, then use QDQL to: predict a diagnostic category, detect a critical or non-critical condition and identify complex symptom combinations.
Choosing Quantum Deep Q-Learning (QDQL) for complex medical diagnosis is a forward-thinking strategy, particularly in high-dimensional and data-intensive clinical environments.
The study ia at the intersection of artificial intelligence, quantum computing and healthcare. If you are interested, you can join our team.
